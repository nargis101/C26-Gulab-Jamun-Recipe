Follow these steps to create your gulab jamun:

1. In a large bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour (maida) and baking powder, then mix well.
2. After, mix in the melted ghee, then pour in the milk as required, and continue to mix until it's a soft dough. 
3. Cover and let it rest for 10 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, in a deep pan, pour in the sugar, water, cardamom and saffron. Mix well and boil for 5 minutes.
5. After, stir in the lemon juice and rose water. Set aside.

6. Next, fill a large pan halfway with oil. Heat over medium heat for at least 5 minutes.
7. Lightly grease your hands with oil and start forming small balls. Reduce the heat of the oil to low, and fry the ball in one or two batches.
8. After 5 minutes, they will start to float, and expand to twice their original size. After the jamun float, increase the heat to medium, and turn them frequently until light golden.
9. Remove the gulab jamuns and allow them to cool on paper towels.

10. Lastly, place the balls into the pan with the syrup and let it rest for 2 hours. 

THEN ENJOY!!!
